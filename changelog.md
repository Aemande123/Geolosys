# Geolosys Changelog

## 4.0.5

### Fixed

* Nether Quartz generating in the Nether

## 4.0.4

### Fixed

* Kimberlite samples not dropping anything
* Sample Item Models now render correctly (should look better in creative menu + TOP + HWYLA)
* ConcurrentModificationException with `serializeNBT()` in `IGeolosysCapability`

## 4.0.3

### Fixed

* Typo and format errors in the field manual
* Disabling Vanilla Ore Gen removing all sand, gravel and clay

## 4.0.2

### Added

* Field Manual is back! Everything's working! (I think)
* Field Manual is gifted to you once (can be configured not to)

### Fixed

* Server crash due to weirdness with "`ItemStackTileEntityRenderer`"

## 4.0.1

### Added

* Compatability drops (waiting on [this bug to be fixed](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/5828)) - once the bug is fixed it should work without me updating
* Ability to gift players a (currently non-functioning ðŸ¤”) Field Manual the first time they join the game - there is a config for this.
 
### Changed

* Internal API stuff to make sure pending blocks work consistently.
* ProPick Recipe (It's now three iron aross the top row, two sticks down the remaining empty right columns)

### Fixed

* ProPick not having recipe
* Python scripts I wrote being packaged with the mod

## 4.0.0

### What Works

* All ore gen and stone gen, just like how it used to work
* JSON customization, just like it was
* Most other major components except for what's listed below:

### What Hasn't Been Implemented Yet

* Campatibility drops (waiting on [this bug to be fixed](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/5828))
* Geolosys "RetroGen" 
* Most user entries
* Most mod compat

### What has been Permanently Removed

* Some compatibility  - not much, but some of it was modifying drops (e.g. Nuclearcraft compat). This has been permanently removed because **you can change this yourself using a datapack!**.

### Mod Changes

* Samples can break if you fall on them
* Samples can now be waterlogged (hence there isn't a "can place in water" config because they should always be able to).
* Samples now have random X/Z offsets (like flowers) for more realistism
* `dimBlacklist` is no longer a list of integers (e.g. `[-1, 1]`) - it's now a string of resource locations (e.g. `["the_end", "extrautils2:deep dark"]`, etc.)
* Propick recipe: no longer requires an iron block (that didn't make sense)

### API Changes

* The API has been moved out of the `common` package and into the main `geolosys` package.
* IOre â†’ IDeposit
* The API is now *much* reduced - the API now only consists of:
    1. `GEOLOSYS_WORLD_CAPABILITY`: The capability used for storing:
        1. What chunks have already had ore plutons checked for
        2. What chunks have already had stone plutons checked for
        3. What chunks have already been retrogenned (not yet used)
        4. Pending blocks per-chunk (blocks that need to be placed at a blockpos but haven't been because that would cause cascading lag)
    2. `proPickExtras`: Extra `BlockState` entries to look for when prospecting
    3. `oreConverterBlacklist`: Which ores not to convert as a part of "retrogenning" (not yet used)
    4. A `PlutonRegistry` instance, allowing access to add, get and remove all `ore` and `stone` IDeposits used by Geolosys
* New `BlockPosDim` class for dimension-defined BlockPoses (used for pending blocks)
* Move BlockPosDim/ChunkPosDim to their own classes for clarity
