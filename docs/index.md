# Overview

Geolosys is a Minecraft Forge mod written to be completely compatible with as many mods as possible, while bring about the realism that is seen in more invasive mods like TerraFirmaCraft. This mod is designed with inter-mod compatibility in mind, such as the ability to silk touch ores to retrieve their vanilla variant and more!

The mod is designed to completely overhaul ore generation, so with the default configurations you will have to rely on it for even Vanilla ore resources. As I have written an incredibly extensive in-game guide (See the Field Manual recipe below), I will not go into detail of all the mechanics on this site. Mostly, I will cover the API and CraftTweaker integrations
